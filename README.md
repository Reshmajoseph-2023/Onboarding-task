*****Overview*****

An online skill exchange platform where you can share your skills with another person in exchange for money or learn new skills. Users can list their skills on the site, and while guest users can search for the skills they are looking for, skill seekers can buy the skills or negotiate to learn them by exchanging their own skills. If a deal is made, the users can use the platform to manage their expectations and outcomes.

*****My role and duties*****

In this project, I tested the key features related to user-known languages and skills listed in the user profile. My role involved preparing and executing manual test cases for languages and skills within the user profile features in Project Mars. I automated test cases using C# and Selenium Web Driver, focusing on the Specflow framework with BDD.
